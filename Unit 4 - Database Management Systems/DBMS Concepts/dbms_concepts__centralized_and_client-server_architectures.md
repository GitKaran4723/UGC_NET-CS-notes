### 1. **Basic Understanding of the Topic Name**

* **Centralized Architecture**: All data and DBMS software reside on a single server (central site).
* **Client/Server Architecture**: The database is hosted on a server, and clients connect over a network to request data or services.

**Analogy**:

* Centralized = A library with one reading room and books stored inside.
* Client/Server = People reading books from the library remotely via internet.

### 2. **Explanation of the Topic**

#### ðŸ”¹ Centralized Database Architecture

* **Structure**: All data, DBMS, and processing occur on a **single machine**.
* **Users** access the system via terminals or thin clients.
* **Advantages**:

  * Easy to manage
  * High security
  * No data redundancy
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Single point of failure
  * Poor scalability
  * Network bottlenecks

#### ðŸ”¹ Client/Server Database Architecture

* Divides responsibilities:

  * **Client**: User interface and application logic
  * **Server**: Data storage and query processing
* Communication via **network protocols** (like TCP/IP)

##### Types of Client/Server:

1. **Two-Tier Architecture**:

   * Client â†” Database Server
   * Application and UI at client side.
   * Example: VB application accessing MS SQL Server

2. **Three-Tier Architecture**:

   * Client â†” Application Server â†” Database Server
   * Improves scalability, security, maintainability
   * Example: Web browser â†” Flask/Django app â†” MySQL DB

### 3. **Relevance in Computer Science**

* Fundamental to **modern database design and deployment**.
* Forms the basis of:

  * Web applications
  * ERP systems
  * Distributed computing

### 4. **UGC NET CSE Relevance**

* **Paper II**: Often asked theoretically and with diagrams.
* **Topics asked**: Advantages, comparison, types of architecture.
* **Expected Frequency**: **Moderately Expected**

### 5. **Applications in CS Projects / Research**

* **Projects**:

  * Campus management system using three-tier architecture
  * Android app with cloud-based DB (Firebase = client/server)
* **Used In**:

  * Banking apps, e-commerce platforms, social media backends
* **Research**:

  * Load balancing in DB servers
  * Fault tolerance in client/server DB systems

2. **Which of the following is true for a centralized database?**
   a) Difficult to maintain security
   b) Redundant data exists
   c) High chance of data inconsistency
   d) All data resides at one location
   **Ans**: d) All data resides at one location

#### Short Answer:

3. **Differentiate between centralized and client/server database systems.** *\[Moderate]*
