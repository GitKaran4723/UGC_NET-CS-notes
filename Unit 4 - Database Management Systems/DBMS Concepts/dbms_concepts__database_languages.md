### 1. **Basic Understanding of the Topic Name**

* **Database**: An organized collection of related data.
* **Languages**: Sets of commands used to define, modify, control, and query data.

**Database Languages** allow users to interact with the database using a structured and rule-based approach.

### 2. **Explanation of the Topic**

Database languages are categorized based on their purpose in managing databases:

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. **DDL â€“ Data Definition Language**

Used to define or modify the structure of database objects like tables, schemas, indexes.

* Commands:

  * `CREATE` â€“ Create database objects
  * `ALTER` â€“ Modify table structure
  * `DROP` â€“ Delete objects
  * `TRUNCATE` â€“ Remove all rows but keep structure

#### ðŸ”¹ 2. **DML â€“ Data Manipulation Language**

Used to manipulate the actual data inside tables.

* Commands:

  * `SELECT` â€“ Retrieve data
  * `INSERT` â€“ Add new records
  * `UPDATE` â€“ Modify existing data
  * `DELETE` â€“ Remove data

#### ðŸ”¹ 3. **DCL â€“ Data Control Language**

Used to control access and permissions.

* Commands:

  * `GRANT` â€“ Provide access rights
  * `REVOKE` â€“ Take back rights

#### ðŸ”¹ 4. **TCL â€“ Transaction Control Language**

Used to manage transactions in the database.

* Commands:

  * `COMMIT` â€“ Save changes
  * `ROLLBACK` â€“ Undo changes
  * `SAVEPOINT` â€“ Mark a point for rollback

### 3. **Relevance in Computer Science**

* Fundamental for **backend programming**, **data management**, and **security**.
* Used in almost all **software development**, **data analysis**, **web applications**, and **ERP systems**.

### 4. **UGC NET CSE Relevance**

* Frequently asked in **Paper II**.
* Often tested through command identification or usage questions.
* **Expected Frequency**: **Highly Expected**.

### 5. **Applications in CS Projects / Research**

* Creating and modifying databases (DDL)
* Populating and querying tables (DML)
* Managing user roles and access (DCL)
* Maintaining data integrity during updates (TCL)

**Used In**:

* Python (via SQLAlchemy), Java (via JDBC), Web apps (PHP/MySQL), Data tools (Power BI, Tableau)
