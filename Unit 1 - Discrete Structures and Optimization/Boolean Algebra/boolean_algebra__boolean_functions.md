## 🧠 1. Basic Understanding of the Topic Name

* **Boolean**: Refers to a branch of algebra where variables have two possible values: `1 (true)` or `0 (false)`.
* **Function**: A relationship that maps input values to a single output.
* **Boolean Function**: A function that returns either 0 or 1 based on logical operations on binary variables.

📌 *Think of it like a light switch system where multiple switches (inputs) determine whether the bulb (output) is ON (1) or OFF (0).*

## 📘 2. Explanation of the Topic

A **Boolean function** takes binary inputs and produces a binary output using logic operations like AND (·), OR (+), NOT (‾). For example:

* `F(A, B) = A · B` is true only when both A and B are true (1).
* Boolean functions can be:

  * **Represented** using truth tables.
  * **Simplified** using Boolean algebra rules or Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps).
  * **Implemented** in digital circuits.

**Example:**
Let `F(A, B, C) = A + (B · C)`

* Inputs: 3 variables → 2³ = 8 combinations.
* Output: Calculated for each row using logical rules.

## 💻 3. Relevance in Computer Science

* Forms the **foundation of digital electronics and logic design**.
* Used in:

  * **Computer architecture**: designing logic gates and circuits.
  * **Programming**: condition checking (`if`, `while`, etc.).
  * **Databases and search engines**: logical filters.
  * **AI**: binary classification models.
