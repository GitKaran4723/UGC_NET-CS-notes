## 1. Basic Understanding of the Topic Name

**Propositional Logic**
👉 **Propositional**: refers to *propositions*, which are statements that are either **true** or **false**, but not both.
👉 **Logic**: is the *systematic study of valid reasoning and inference*.

**Together**: Propositional logic deals with *manipulating and analyzing whole statements* (propositions) using logical operators.

🔸 Example of propositions:

* "The sky is blue." → can be true or false → valid proposition.
* "Please close the door." → not true/false → not a proposition.

---

## 2. Explanation of the Topic

### ✨ Basic Structure

* Propositions → represented by variables like **P**, **Q**, **R**, etc.
* Connectors → logical operators that combine propositions:

  * **¬P** → NOT P (negation)
  * **P ∧ Q** → P AND Q (conjunction)
  * **P ∨ Q** → P OR Q (disjunction)
  * **P → Q** → If P then Q (implication)
  * **P ↔ Q** → P if and only if Q (biconditional)

### ✨ Truth Tables

Used to systematically list truth values of compound propositions.
Example for **P ∧ Q**:

| P | Q | P ∧ Q |
| - | - | ----- |
| T | T | T     |
| T | F | F     |
| F | T | F     |
| F | F | F     |

### ✨ Logical Equivalences

Statements that are logically the same:

* **De Morgan’s Laws**:

  * ¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ ¬P ∨ ¬Q
  * ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ ¬P ∧ ¬Q
* **Double Negation**: ¬(¬P) ≡ P

### ✨ Normal Forms

* **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**: AND of ORs
* **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**: OR of ANDs

These forms are useful for **automated reasoning** and **computer logic design**.

Here’s a very simple and clear explanation of **CNF** and **DNF** — this is **frequently asked** in **UGC NET CSE**.

---

### **CNF** → *Conjunctive Normal Form*

**Meaning:**
A formula in propositional logic is in **CNF** if it is an **AND** ( ∧ ) of **clauses**, where each **clause** is an **OR** ( ∨ ) of literals.

* **Literals** = variables (P, Q) or their negations (¬P, ¬Q).

**Form**:

```
(C1) ∧ (C2) ∧ (C3) ∧ ... ∧ (Cn)
where each Ci = (L1 ∨ L2 ∨ ... ∨ Lm)
```

**Example**:

```
(P ∨ ¬Q) ∧ (R ∨ S ∨ T) ∧ (¬P ∨ Q)
```

---

### **DNF** → *Disjunctive Normal Form*

**Meaning:**
A formula is in **DNF** if it is an **OR** ( ∨ ) of **terms**, where each **term** is an **AND** ( ∧ ) of literals.

**Form**:

```
(T1) ∨ (T2) ∨ (T3) ∨ ... ∨ (Tn)
where each Ti = (L1 ∧ L2 ∧ ... ∧ Lm)
```

**Example**:

```
(P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬R ∧ S) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬Q ∧ R)
```

| Big AND of ORs           | Big OR of ANDs             |
| Like a **shopping list** | Like **alternative plans** |
